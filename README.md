# We also sequence these genomes from non-chondrichthyan taxa

## Data Use Policies

As forumated by the [Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP)](https://genome10k.ucsc.edu/data-use-policies/), we genome asssembly producers hold the right to present the results of analyses using the unpublished genome assemblies listed below earlier than other parties. Please be sure to consult Shigehiro Kuraku if you are interested in using the genome assemblies listed below as 'in prep.'.

## Non-chondrichthyan species chosen for whole genome sequencing at Squalomix

Some comments about the status and details of the individual assemblies are included below the table.

| Species |Common name|Technology|Publication|
|----|----|----|----|
| *Geotria australis* | pouched lamprey | illumina short read + mate-pair + Hi-C | in prep. |
| *Mordacia mordax* | southern lamprey | illumina short read + mate-pair + Hi-C | in prep. |
| *Cololabis saira* | Pacific saury | PacBio HiFi + Hi-C | [Sato et al., 2024](https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article/31/2/dsae004/7623430) |

### Cololabis saira

After our fundamental analysis on a non-phased assembly ([Sato et al., 2024](https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article/31/2/dsae004/7623430)), we have made haplotype-phased assemblies ('hap1' and 'hap2') with hifiasm and YaHS, which have been registered under the [BioProject PRJNA1104577](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/1104577) and will be released soon in NCBI (as of May 24, 2024). Those assemblies underwent some manual interventions after computation with YaHS, and we recognize some discrepancies in chromosomal organization between the 'hap1' and 'hap2', which will be amended by our future effort.


### Geotria australis and Mordacia mordax

We are preparing to publish our molecular evolutionary analyses using these assemblies, and the above-mentioned Data Use Policies strictly applies to them.
