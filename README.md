# We also sequence these genomes from non-chondrichthyan taxa

## Data Use Policy

Updated on October 13, 2024

We release our sequence data upon reaching the stage of manuscript preparation based on the generated data. However, if required by funding agencies, we will release the data earlier. In either case, we expect other researchers to respect our right to first present and publish analyses using the data we generate and release. Exceptions to this policy will be considered when researchers contact us to coordinate collaborations prior to data presentation and a formal agreement for collaboration is reached. Please be sure to consult Shigehiro Kuraku if you are interested in using the genome assemblies listed below as 'in prep.'.

Unlike many other genome sequencing consortia, our work is primarily supported by academic, discovery-driven grants, and we have limited personnel dedicated to data finalization and release.


## Non-chondrichthyan species chosen for whole genome sequencing by Squalomix

Some comments about the status and details of the individual assemblies are included below the table.

### Coturnix japonica

An improved chromosome-scale genome assembly has been produced by collaborating with Prof. Nishijima at Avian Bioscience Research Center of Nagoya University who conducts [National BioResource Project (NBRP) for chicken and quail under MEXT, Japan](https://www.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~nbrp/en/organiztion/index.html). It has been submitted to INSDC, and is being processed for public release.

### Nothobranchius furzeri

*Nothobranchius furzeri* is known as African turquoise killifish and is an excellent model organism for aging study, having the shortest captive lifespan among vertebrates and showing highly similar aging phenotypes to humans. In collaboration with [Prof. Tohru Ishitani at RIMD, Osaka University](http://www.biken.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/laboratories/detail/52), we are working for genome assembly improvement for this species, and the first product from this collaboration is available at NCBI ([GCA_043380555.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_043380555.1/)). 

### Cololabis saira

After our fundamental analysis on a non-phased assembly ([Sato et al., 2024](https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article/31/2/dsae004/7623430)), we have made haplotype-phased assemblies ('hap1' and 'hap2') with hifiasm and YaHS, which are available have been registered under the [BioProject PRJNA1104577](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/1104577) and available in NCBI (as of September 11, 2024). Those assemblies underwent some manual interventions after computation with YaHS, and we recognize some discrepancies in chromosomal organization between the 'hap1' and 'hap2', which will be amended by our future effort.

### Geotria australis and Mordacia mordax

We are preparing to publish our molecular evolutionary analyses using these assemblies, and the above-mentioned Data Use Policies strictly applies to them.

### Paroedura picta

To be filled soon.
