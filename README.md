# We also sequence these genomes from non-chondrichthyan taxa

## Data Use Policies

As forumated by the [Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP)](https://genome10k.ucsc.edu/data-use-policies/), we genome asssembly producers hold the right to present the results of analyses using the unpublished genome assemblies listed below earlier than other parties. Please be sure to consult Shigehiro Kuraku if you are interested in using the genome assemblies listed below as 'in prep.'.

## Non-chondrichthyan species chosen for whole genome sequencing by Squalomix

Some comments about the status and details of the individual assemblies are included below the table.

| Species |Common name|Technology|Publication|
|----|----|----|----|
| *Geotria australis* | pouched lamprey | illumina short read + mate-pair + Hi-C | in prep. |
| *Mordacia mordax* | southern lamprey | illumina short read + mate-pair + Hi-C | in prep. |
| *Cololabis saira* | Pacific saury | PacBio HiFi + Hi-C | [Sato et al., 2024](https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article/31/2/dsae004/7623430) |
| *Halichoeres trimaculatus*| Threespot wrasse| PacBio HiFi + Hi-C | [Nozu et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.09.545663v3)|
| *Paroedura picta* | Madagascar ground gecko | PacBio HiFi + Hi-C ||
| *Coturnix japonica* | Japanese quail | PacBio HiFi + Hi-C ||
| *Nothobranchius furzeri* | African turquoise killifish | PacBio HiFi + Hi-C ||

### Coturnix japonica

An improved chromosome-scale genome assembly will be produced by collaborating with Prof. Nishijima at Avian BioScience Research Center of Nagoya University who conducts [National BioResource Project (NBRP) for chicken and quail under MEXT, Japan](https://www.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~nbrp/en/organiztion/index.html).

### Nothobranchius furzeri

*Nothobranchius furzeri* is known as African turquoise killifish and is an excellent model organism for aging study, having the shortest captive lifespan among vertebrates and showing highly similar aging phenotypes to humans. In collaboration with [Prof. Tohru Ishitani at RIMD, Osaka University](http://www.biken.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/laboratories/detail/52), we are working for genome assembly improvement for this species, and the first product from this collaboration will be released soon from NCBI. 

### Cololabis saira

After our fundamental analysis on a non-phased assembly ([Sato et al., 2024](https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article/31/2/dsae004/7623430)), we have made haplotype-phased assemblies ('hap1' and 'hap2') with hifiasm and YaHS, which are available have been registered under the [BioProject PRJNA1104577](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/1104577) and available in NCBI (as of September 11, 2024). Those assemblies underwent some manual interventions after computation with YaHS, and we recognize some discrepancies in chromosomal organization between the 'hap1' and 'hap2', which will be amended by our future effort.

### Geotria australis and Mordacia mordax

We are preparing to publish our molecular evolutionary analyses using these assemblies, and the above-mentioned Data Use Policies strictly applies to them.
